# Practice Website Module 1-5

The purpose of this website was to Practice the lessons from module 1 - 5 from the Scrimba Frontend Career Path.

## Language

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Things I struggled with

* I still find it difficult to add *structure* to my CSS-file
* I wanted to create a section where a part of the section pops out of the container to make it more vivid. In the end I realised something with *translate* but it's not the result I had in mind. In the mobile version it loses this _focus_ effect.
* The slideshow transitions aren't as *fluent* as I wanted
